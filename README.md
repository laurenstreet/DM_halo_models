# DM_halo_models
Testing DM models with SPARC

See *insert publication here* for more information.

## Overview

This repository was created to test several galactic dark matter (DM) models against the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) catalog data (see http://astroweb.case.edu/SPARC/).  It can be used to obtain fit results for each of the DM models analyzed, as well as calculate various properties such as the galactic DM mass, etc.  For more information pertaining to the math and physics behind the calculations, see *insert publication here*.

For more detailed documentation see : https://laurenstreet.github.io/DM_halo_models or DM_halo_models_docs.pdf

## Requirements

## Results

Some example plots from *insert publication here* are shown.  First, we show the results from the ULDM model analysis assuming the particle mass is free to vary in the fitting procedure.  Below is a plot of the difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values between the ULDM and Einasto model vs. ULDM particle mass.

Next, we show the results from the ULDM model analysis assuming the particle mass is fixed and scanned along some range in the fitting procedure.  Below is a plot of the fractional differences in the sum of the reduced chi-square values (summed over galaxies) between the ULDM and Einasto models vs. ULDM particle mass.

We also show the results for the best fit particle masses (for the matched models).  Below are the distributions of the BIC differences between the ULDM and Einasto models for the particle masses fit to the best fit values.

Finally, we show results for the CDM models.  Below are the distributions of BIC differences between each CDM model analyzed.
